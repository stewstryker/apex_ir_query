**tl;dr:** Get the WHERE clause from an Oracle Apex Interactive Report

***Details***

This contains an Oracle PL/SQL package with a single public function which calculates the SQL WHERE clause for the specified Oracle Application Express Interactive Report.  The idea is that you could use this WHERE clause to get the same records displayed on the IR, but format it however you want.

I wrote this back in 2009, but it still seems to work. Caveat emptor, your mileage may vary, etc.
